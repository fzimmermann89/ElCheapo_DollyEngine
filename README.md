DollyEngine - El Cheapo
=========================

This is a modification of the DollyEngine firmware for the MX2 Controller (and clones) with simplified UI and support for one motor only.

This version of the firmware is ready for compiling in Arduino 1.0+

All the Pins (including former PWM Pins) can be changed. Currently set up for use with DFRobot Keypad Shield.
